Just some cheap solutions to the [2016 advent of code problems](http://adventofcode.com/2016/), to brush up on my python.

Some solutions were done by brute-force, in the spirit of keeping the total
amount of time spent on a problem to a minimum. I'd like to clean those up.

They are:

- [ ] polish solution to 11 (run-time)
- [x] polish solution to 18 (run-time)
- [ ] polish solution to 23 (run-time)
- [ ] make the solution to 25 rigid (don't just test first 100)
